1st report
I created the FileHandler class and the DataParser class.
Unfortunately the API does not provide a way to search for any individual competitor
without first finding their ID, which can't be done for any competitor.
As a result, the application only works with ranked fighters.
I tested the functionality of the methods primarily with example XML-files
provided in the API documentation, using REPL to test the API-calls.
This took ~5 hours.

2nd report - First larger whole
I have now fully fleshed out the functionality of the DataParser class and
the FileHandler class, with the exception of saving and loading dashboards.
I also created the FighterData class, along with a FightData class that contains
the information about an individual fight.
REPL as well as test classes have been indispensible in the testing process.
This took about 10 hours.

3rd report - halfway through
I have begun the process of making the UI, with the DashboardGUI class,
so I have now been able to use that class for testing.
Unfortunately, I am not very proficient in creating UI, especially with Swing,
so there has been a lot of trial and error, and I am somewhat behind schedule, especially with creating the UI elements.
I was able to display the fighter data in the UI, though, so now all I have to do is actually finish the UI.
This took about another 5 hours. Luckily, I should have more time to work on the project in the coming weeks.

4th report - almost there
I have now implemented the basic systems for adding different kinds of elements. I have also mostly implemented the scater chart.
Unfortunately, I experienced a massive setback in having to switch from Scala Swing to ScalaFX.
This is because swing contains no tools for making charts. This would be fine if the charts only had to be simple
and purely graphical, but the level of interactivity required means that switching to ScalaFX was my only option.
At this point, I have been able to test everything in the actual UI, which has been very useful.
Getting back to this point took about 15 hours, including the time I had to spend learning the new library.
I am still behind schedule, but I am now in a good place to grind through to the end.
