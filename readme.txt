This is a sports statistics dashboard project for the UFC. Made in Scala.

The API calls will not work, unless a valid API key is provided in apikey.txt
The dashboard will thus only work for fighters whose data is in the FighterData file, unless you provide an API key

The API in use can be found here (to make a valid API key you will have to create an account)
